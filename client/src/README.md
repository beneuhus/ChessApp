# Fire Kangaroo Chess App | Front-End

## Design and User Experience:
### MVP
- Consistent Styling: Maintain a consistent look and feel across all pages of the application. This includes consistent use of colors, fonts, and layout styles.

- Intuitive Layout: Design the layout of each page to be intuitive and easy to understand. Users should be able to quickly understand how to use the application without needing extensive instructions.
- Responsive Design: The design should be responsive, meaning it should look good on all devices, from desktop computers to tablets to mobile phones. This might involve using flexible layouts, media queries, and other responsive design techniques.
Stretch Goals
- Visual Feedback: Provide visual feedback for user interactions. For example, when a user clicks a button, the button might change color to indicate that it's been clicked.
- Animations: Consider using subtle animations to enhance the user experience. For example, you might animate the movement of chess pieces, or you might use a transition animation when switching between pages.
- Error States: Design error states for the application. If something goes wrong (like a network error), you should show a helpful error message to the user.
Dark Mode: Consider offering a dark mode for the application. Some users prefer a dark color scheme, especially when using applications in low light conditions.
